      <b>What is Qi?</b>
    </h4>
    <p>Qi is energy in the very broadest sense possible, it is universal, it embraces all manifestations of energy, most material
      aspects of energy (such as the earth beneath your feet, your computer, and flesh and blood) to the most immaterial
      aspects (light, movement, heat, nerve impulses, thought, and emotion). </p>

    <h4>
      <b>Why Optimize Qi?</b>
    </h4>
    <p>Qi relates to both substance and function, Qi is in a state of continuous flux, transforming endlessly from one aspect
      of Qi into another. It is neither created nor is it ever destroyed for this reason its optimizations allow for overall
      good health.</p>
